# AIC_study
Short simulation study to answer question 1.2 of  Reviewer 1 concerning wether the AIC can detect model miss-specifications in the transmission model or not. For this we simulate from a simple SIRS model with birth and death and exponentially distributed infectious period with mean 1/gamma. We let the system equilibrate so that it reaches the endemic state. Moreover we simulate from a similar  SIRS model with the only difference that now the infectious period is Gamma(3,gamma*3) distributed. Both models have the same mean of infectious period which is '1/\gamma'. We treat the simulations (sir1_data.txt and sir2_data.txt) as data and fit them to the respective models.
