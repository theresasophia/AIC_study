# AIC_study
Short simulation study to answer question 1.2 of  Reviewer 1 concerning wether the AIC can detect model miss-specifications in the transmission model or not. For this we simulate from a simple SIRS model with birth and death and exponentially distributed infectious period with mean 1/gamma. We let the system equilibrate so that it reaches the endemic state. Moreover we simulate from a similar  SIRS model with the only difference that now the infectious period is Gamma(3,gamma*3) distributed. Both models have the same mean of infectious period 1/gamma. We treat the simulations (sir1_data.txt and sir2_data.txt) as data and fit them to the respective models. We only fit the parameter \beta and keep all other parameters fixed at their true value. We do this because this is most similar to what we did in the manuscript.

*So far it shows that the reviewer was right and the AIC cannot distinguish the two models. Please check if there is something wrong?? Tom says we could use this result as a justification of why we only chose exponential waiting times: since there is so little signal in the data and we cannot detect the different distributions anyways it is enough to use exponential.*
